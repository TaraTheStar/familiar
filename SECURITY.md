# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately**. Do not open a public
issue, PR, or discussion thread for anything that looks like a
vulnerability.

Two ways to reach the maintainer:

1. **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** (preferred) — on the
   repo, click **Security → Report a vulnerability**. This opens a
   private advisory only the maintainer can see.
2. **Email** — <TaraTheStar@proton.me>. PGP not currently offered;
   if you need encrypted transport, say so in a first-contact email
   and we'll arrange a key exchange.

Please include:

- A description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof-of-concept.
- Which component and revision it affects.
- Whether you'd like credit in the eventual advisory.

## Scope

familiar is an umbrella repo — documentation plus the `grimoire`
and `poppet` submodules.

In scope:

- Content and build tooling in this repo (the `docs/` Hugo site and
  the GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/`).
- Anything in the pinned submodule revisions that this repo vouches
  for by referencing them.

Out of scope:

- Vulnerabilities whose root cause lives in a submodule's own
  upstream repo — report those against that repo, which carries its
  own `SECURITY.md`.
- Issues in third-party tools (Hugo, Actions) that we merely invoke;
  report those upstream.

## Disclosure

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and ship a fix or a
mitigation plan within 30 days for confirmed issues. Coordinated
disclosure timelines are negotiable for complex bugs; please say so
in your report.
